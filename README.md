## 🔑 How It Works
KanaShift uses advanced cryptography to transform your text. Here's a quick overview of the process:

- **Input Text**: Type in the text you want to mask.
- **Password**: Enter a password. This password is your key. Make sure to remember it.
- **Transformation**: The application uses a PBKDF2-hardened keystream to transmute your input into Japanese glyphs.
- **Output**: The masked output displays as garbled text, making it unreadable to anyone without the correct password.

## 💡 Features
- **Password-bound**: Only you can unlock your masked text.
- **Reversible**: Easily decode your text when needed.
